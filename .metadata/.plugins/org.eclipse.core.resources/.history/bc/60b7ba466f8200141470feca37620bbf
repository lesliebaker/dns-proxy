I wrote my proxy server in Java.

My tarball should expand to contain this readme file and a src folder.
  - src contains my source code (in three packages)
  - To run my server from a unix terminal, make sure you're in the src folder
  - To compile: $ javac proxy/ProxyCache.java (there is a warning about using a deprecated
    API - this refers to using readLine() on a DataInputStream. It was in the skeleton and it
    still works so I kept it.)
  - To run: $ java proxy/ProxyCache <port_num>
  - Alternatively, you could import the packages into Eclipse... but command line is probably
    easier
